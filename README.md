# Customer-Shopping-Analysis
## Project objective
This project analyzes customer shopping patterns using Python, SQL, and Power BI. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, SQL-based business insights, and an interactive dashboard showing revenue trends, customer segmentation, and purchase behavior

## Dataset

## Questions(KPI'S)
- What is the total revenue generated by male vs female customers?
- Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average purchase amount?
- What are the top 5 products with the highest average rating?
- How does the average purchase amount compare between Standard and Express Shipping?
- Do subscribed customers spend more than non-subscribers?
- Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?
- How can customers be segmented into New, Returning, and Loyal based on previous purchases?
- What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?
- Are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) more likely to subscribe?
- What is the revenue contribution of each age group?

 ## Process 
1. Data Collection

- The dataset (customer_shopping_behaviour.csv) contains customer details such as age, gender, purchase amount, item purchased, category, rating, subscription status, etc.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

- Loaded data using Pandas.

- Cleaned missing values and standardized column names.

- Created additional columns (e.g., age_group).

- Ensured data types were consistent for numerical and categorical columns.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed customer demographics, purchase patterns, and category performance.

- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn (e.g., revenue by gender, top-selling categories, customer age distribution).

4. SQL Analysis

- Imported the cleaned data into MySQL.

- Wrote SQL queries to extract business insights:

  - Revenue by gender

 - Subscription vs non-subscription spending

 - Top products by rating and category

 - Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

 - Discount and shipping analysis

5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

- Connected Power BI to the processed dataset or SQL database.

- Built interactive visuals for KPIs such as:

 - Total Revenue

 - Average Purchase Value

 - Revenue by Gender, Category, and Age Group

 - Top Products and Loyal Customer Insights

6. Insights & Conclusion

- Identified trends in customer behavior and spending patterns.

- Highlighted factors influencing higher sales (like discounts, subscriptions, and shipping type).

- Summarized findings in Power BI for better decision-making.
